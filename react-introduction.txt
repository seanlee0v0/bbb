Why React?
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.It was built to solve one problem:building large applications with data that changes over time.

Simple
Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automactically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.

Declarative
When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.

Build Composable Components
React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the only thing you do is build components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.


React can also render on server by nodejs.(Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.)
